* You can undo and redo your action, which include creating a shape, loading file, changing the location, color and fill state of a selected shape, cleaning the canvas.
* The ratio of both rectangle and ellipse can be locked with shift key when drawing, which make them square and circle respectively.
* All drawn shapes can be saved as .vec file, and the saved files can be loaded back to the canvas.
